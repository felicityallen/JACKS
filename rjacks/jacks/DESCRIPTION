Description: JACKS (Joint Analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout Screens), is a Bayesian analysis method 
    for CRISPR/Cas9 screens. It models the measured effect elicited by every gRNA in each experiment 
    as a normal distribution whose mean is decomposed into two orthogonal components:
    a condition-dependent gene effect, and a condition-independent gRNA efficacy effect. 
    JACKS uses variational inference to estimate probability distributions for both components, 
    whilst also accounting for variability due to experimental noise. This has proven to be beneficial
    for improving sensitivity in analysing multiple large scale screens.
